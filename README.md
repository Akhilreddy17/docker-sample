An example Dockerfile for a Java webapp + a few dependencies:

 * JDK 7
 * Apache 2
 * PostgreSQL 9.3
 * git 1.7
 * Maven 3.1.1

Build
=====

Steps to build a Docker image:

1. Clone this repo

    git clone https://github.com/cb372/docker-sample.git

2. Manually download JDK 7u45 (x64 rpm) from the Oracle site

3. Copy the JDK rpm to the appropriate folder

   cd docker-sample
   mkdir jdk
   cp ~/Downloads/jdk-7u45-linux-x64.rpm jdk

4. Build the image

    cd ..
    docker build -t="my-app" docker-sample

This will take a few minutes.

5. Run the image's default command, which should start everything up.

    docker run my-app

6. Once everything has started up, you should be able to access the webapp via [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) on your host machine.

    open http://localhost/
